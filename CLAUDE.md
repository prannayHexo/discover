# Git Workflow

- **Fork remote:** `fork` → https://github.com/Pran-Ker/discover.git (push all commits here)
- **Upstream remote:** `origin` → https://github.com/prannayHexo/discover.git (create PRs against this)
- Always push to `fork`, never directly to `origin`
- When creating PRs, push branch to `fork` then open PR against `origin/main`
